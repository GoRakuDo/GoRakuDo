# Advanced Mining Techniques with Migaku

Once you've mastered the basics of Migaku, it's time to explore advanced mining techniques that will help you extract maximum value from your Japanese content consumption.

## Understanding Mining Efficiency

### What Makes Good Mining Content?

The best content for mining has:

- **Clear audio**: Good pronunciation and clear speech
- **Accurate subtitles**: Japanese subtitles that match the audio
- **Appropriate difficulty**: Content slightly above your current level
- **Engaging material**: Content you actually want to watch

### Mining Frequency Guidelines

- **Beginner**: 5-10 new words per episode
- **Intermediate**: 10-20 new words per episode  
- **Advanced**: 20-30 new words per episode

### 2. Batch Mining

Instead of mining one word at a time:

1. **Watch first**: Watch the content without mining
2. **Identify targets**: Note down words you want to learn
3. **Mine in batches**: Go back and mine multiple words together
4. **Review context**: Ensure you understand how words are used

### 3. Context Mining

When mining vocabulary:

- **Mine in context**: Include the sentence where the word appears
