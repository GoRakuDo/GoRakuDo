# Getting Started with Migaku

Migaku is a powerful browser extension designed to help you learn Japanese through immersive content consumption.

## What is Migaku?

Migaku is a browser extension that transforms your web browsing into a Japanese learning experience. It provides:

- **Subtitle mining**: Extract vocabulary from videos with subtitles
- **Anki integration**: Automatically create flashcards from mined content
- **Reading assistance**: Help with reading Japanese text on web pages
- **Immersion tracking**: Monitor your daily Japanese exposure

## Installation

1. Visit the [Migaku website](https://migaku.io)
2. Download the browser extension for your preferred browser
3. Follow the installation instructions
4. Create a Migaku account

## Basic Setup

### 1. Connect to Anki

Migaku works best when connected to Anki:

1. Open Anki and ensure it's running
2. In Migaku settings, enter your Anki connection details
3. Test the connection to ensure it's working

### 2. Configure Your Learning Settings

2. **Mine vocabulary**: Use Migaku to extract new words from subtitles
3. **Review regularly**: Study the flashcards created in Anki
4. **Track progress**: Monitor your daily immersion time

## Tips for Success

- **Consistency is key**: Aim for daily usage, even if just for 30 minutes
- **Quality over quantity**: Focus on understanding rather than speed
- **Use multiple sources**: Combine anime, dramas, and reading materials
- **Review regularly**: Don't let mined vocabulary pile up without review

## Common Issues

- Check firewall settings
