- **OPS-001**: Development server compatibility tests
  - Test scenarios: 2.2-E2E-004
  - Required test types: Runtime environment validation
  - Test data requirements: Development server configuration

### Priority 3: Low Risk Tests

- **TECH-003**: Directory naming validation tests
  - Test scenarios: 2.2-E2E-001, 2.2-E2E-002
  - Required test types: File system validation
  - Test data requirements: Directory structure verification

- **OPS-002**: Schema compatibility tests
  - Test scenarios: 2.2-E2E-005
  - Required test types: Content collection validation
  - Test data requirements: Schema definition files

- **BUS-001**: Migration readiness tests
  - Test scenarios: 2.2-INT-003, 2.2-E2E-005
  - Required test types: Integration validation
  - Test data requirements: Content migration test data

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### TECH-001: Directory Permission Issues

**Strategy**: Preventive
**Actions**:
- Verify user has full read/write permissions to `src/content/` directory
- Check for any file system restrictions or quotas
- Ensure proper ownership of target directories
- Test directory creation in isolated environment first

**Testing Requirements**:
- File system permission validation tests
- Directory creation failure scenarios
- Permission escalation testing

**Residual Risk**: Low - File system permissions are typically straightforward
**Owner**: Developer
**Timeline**: Before story implementation

### TECH-002: Build System Recognition

**Strategy**: Preventive
**Actions**:
- Verify Astro configuration supports custom content directories
- Check for any hardcoded path references in build configuration
- Test build process with minimal directory structure
- Validate content collection schema compatibility

**Testing Requirements**:
- Build pipeline integration tests
- Configuration validation tests
- Schema compatibility tests

**Residual Risk**: Medium - Build system integration can have unexpected dependencies
**Owner**: Developer
**Timeline**: During story implementation

### TECH-003: Naming Conflicts

**Strategy**: Detective
**Actions**:
- Scan existing directory structure for conflicts
- Use descriptive, unique directory names
- Follow project naming conventions
- Document directory purpose and structure

**Testing Requirements**:
- Directory conflict detection tests
- Naming convention validation
- Structure documentation review

**Residual Risk**: Low - Naming conflicts are easily detectable
**Owner**: Developer
**Timeline**: Before story implementation

### OPS-001: Development Server Compatibility

**Strategy**: Preventive
**Actions**:
- Test development server with new directory structure
- Verify hot reload functionality works correctly
- Check for any server configuration requirements
- Validate file watching and serving capabilities

**Testing Requirements**:
- Development server integration tests
- Hot reload functionality tests
- File serving validation tests

**Residual Risk**: Medium - Development server behavior can vary by environment
**Owner**: Developer
**Timeline**: During story implementation

### OPS-002: Schema Compatibility

**Strategy**: Detective
**Actions**:
- Review content collection schema definitions
- Validate directory structure against schema requirements
- Test content file creation in new directories
- Verify schema validation passes

**Testing Requirements**:
- Schema validation tests
- Content creation tests
- Schema compatibility tests

**Residual Risk**: Low - Schema issues are typically caught during development
**Owner**: Developer
**Timeline**: During story implementation

### BUS-001: Content Migration Blocking

**Strategy**: Preventive
**Actions**:
- Ensure directory structure meets content migration requirements
- Validate file permissions for content creation
- Test content file operations in new directories
- Document any migration prerequisites

**Testing Requirements**:
- Migration readiness tests
- Content operation tests
- Integration validation tests

**Residual Risk**: Low - Migration blocking issues are easily detectable
**Owner**: Developer
**Timeline**: Before story completion

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

- All high risks (score 6) - Directory permission issues
- All medium risks affecting build system (score 4)

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- Medium risks with compensating controls
- Low risks with monitoring in place

### Accepted Risks

- **TECH-003**: Naming conflicts (easily detectable and fixable)
- **OPS-002**: Schema compatibility (caught during development)
- **BUS-001**: Migration blocking (detectable before story 2.3)

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- Build success rates for TECH risks
- Development server stability for OPS risks
- Content creation success rates for business risks

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- File system permissions change
- Astro configuration is modified
- Content collection schema is updated
- Development environment changes
- Story 2.3 requirements are finalized

## Risk-Based Recommendations

### Testing Priority

1. **First**: Permission and directory creation tests (TECH-001)
2. **Second**: Build system integration tests (TECH-002, OPS-001)
3. **Third**: Schema and migration readiness tests (remaining risks)

### Development Focus

- File system permission validation
- Build configuration review
- Directory structure documentation
- Integration testing with Astro

### Deployment Strategy

- Test in development environment first
- Verify build process completes successfully
- Validate development server functionality
- Document any environment-specific requirements

### Monitoring Setup

- Build success/failure tracking
- Development server error monitoring
- Directory structure validation checks
- Content creation test results
