## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: High Risk Tests

- **TECH-001**: Comprehensive schema validation tests
  - Test all required fields presence and format
  - Test optional fields validation
  - Test build process with malformed content
  - Test schema error handling and reporting

### Priority 2: Medium Risk Tests

- **TECH-002**: Frontmatter compliance verification
  - Audit all frontmatter fields against schema
  - Validate field types and formats
  - Test edge cases in field values

- **TECH-003**: Content rendering validation
  - Test content display in development environment
  - Verify responsive design compliance
  - Test content navigation and accessibility

### Priority 3: Low Risk Tests

- **TECH-004**: Build performance monitoring
- **DATA-001**: Content integrity verification
- **OPS-001**: Development environment validation
- **OPS-002**: Documentation completeness check
- **BUS-001**: Content quality assessment

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

- All schema validation failures (TECH-001)
- Critical frontmatter mismatches (TECH-002)

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- Content rendering issues with workarounds (TECH-003)
- Build performance issues with monitoring (TECH-004)

### Accepted Risks

- Minor documentation gaps (OPS-002)
- Low-impact content quality issues (BUS-001)

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- Build success rates and performance metrics
- Content validation error rates
- Content rendering success rates
- Development environment stability

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- Schema definition changes
- Build system updates
- Content structure modifications
- Performance issues reported
- Content quality issues discovered

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### TECH-001: Schema Validation Failures
**Strategy**: Preventive
**Actions**:
- Implement comprehensive schema validation in build process
- Add pre-commit hooks for content validation
- Create automated validation scripts
**Testing Requirements**:
- Unit tests for schema validation functions
- Integration tests for build process
- Manual validation of all content files

### TECH-002: Frontmatter Field Mismatches
**Strategy**: Preventive
**Actions**:
- Audit all existing content against schema
- Create validation checklist for content creators
- Implement automated frontmatter validation
**Testing Requirements**:
- Manual audit of all frontmatter fields
- Automated validation script testing
- Content creation workflow testing

### TECH-003: Content Rendering Issues
**Strategy**: Detective
**Actions**:
- Comprehensive testing in development environment
- Responsive design validation across breakpoints
- Accessibility testing for content display
**Testing Requirements**:
- Cross-browser testing
- Responsive design testing at all breakpoints
- Accessibility compliance testing

## Overall Risk Assessment

This story presents **moderate risk** with one high-risk item requiring careful attention. The primary focus should be on schema validation and content compliance verification. The existing content appears well-structured, reducing the likelihood of major issues, but thorough validation is essential to ensure successful integration with the new system.

**Recommendation**: Proceed with implementation but prioritize schema validation testing and have rollback procedures ready for any content rendering issues.
