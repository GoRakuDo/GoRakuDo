## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: High Risk Tests

- **TECH-001 & TECH-002**: Comprehensive link validation testing
  - Test all tool card navigation paths
  - Verify dynamic routing for all tool IDs
  - Test direct URL access to tool pages
  - Validate tool ID consistency across components

### Priority 2: Medium Risk Tests

- **OPS-001**: Complete testing coverage
  - Cross-browser testing on all supported browsers
  - Mobile responsive testing across all breakpoints
  - Performance baseline testing
  - Accessibility testing for navigation

### Priority 3: Low Risk Tests

- **TECH-003**: Animation integrity testing
- **TECH-004**: Build performance monitoring
- **PERF-001**: Page load time validation
- **BUS-001**: User experience validation

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### TECH-001: Tool ID Mapping Inconsistency
**Mitigation Strategy**: Preventive
**Actions**:
- Implement systematic tool ID validation in build process
- Add automated checks for ID consistency across files
- Create tool ID mapping documentation
**Testing Requirements**:
- Automated link validation tests
- Build-time consistency checks
- Manual verification of all navigation paths

### TECH-002: Dynamic Routing Failures
**Mitigation Strategy**: Preventive
**Actions**:
- Comprehensive testing of dynamic route generation
- Validation of tool ID to route mapping
- Fallback handling for invalid tool IDs
**Testing Requirements**:
- Unit tests for route generation logic
- Integration tests for dynamic routing
- Error handling tests for invalid routes

### OPS-001: Incomplete Testing
**Mitigation Strategy**: Detective
**Actions**:
- Implement comprehensive test checklist
- Add automated testing for critical paths
- Establish testing completion criteria
**Testing Requirements**:
- Test coverage analysis
- Automated regression tests
- Manual testing validation

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

- All high risks (TECH-001, TECH-002) must be fully mitigated
- Complete testing coverage for all navigation paths

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- Medium risks with compensating controls
- Low risks with monitoring in place

### Accepted Risks

- PERF-002: Minimal bundle size increase is acceptable
- TECH-003: Animation issues can be addressed post-deployment if they occur

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- **Performance Metrics**: Page load times, bundle sizes
- **Error Rates**: 404 errors on tool pages, navigation failures
- **User Experience**: Navigation success rates, user feedback
- **Build Performance**: Build times, deployment success rates

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- New tools are added to the system
- Dynamic routing logic changes
- Performance issues are reported
- User navigation problems are identified
- Build system modifications are made

## Risk Score Calculation

**Base Score**: 100
**Deductions**:
- High Risks (6): -20 points (2 × 10)
- Medium Risks (4): -15 points (3 × 5)
- Low Risks (2): -6 points (3 × 2)
- Minimal Risk (1): -1 point (1 × 1)

**Final Score**: 82/100 (Low Risk Profile)
