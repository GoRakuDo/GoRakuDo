Date: 2024-12-19
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Executive Summary

- Total Risks Identified: 8
- Critical Risks: 0
- High Risks: 3
- Risk Score: 65/100 (calculated)

## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

*No critical risks identified (score â‰¥ 9)*

## High Risks Requiring Attention

### 1. PERF-001: Build Time Performance Degradation

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: High - Story explicitly acknowledges 10-15% build time increase
**Impact**: Medium - Could impact development workflow and CI/CD pipeline efficiency
**Mitigation**:

- Implement performance monitoring as specified in story
- Consider caching strategies for tag filtering results
- Optimize tag filtering algorithm if performance targets exceeded

**Testing Focus**: Performance benchmarks before/after implementation, monitoring during development

### 2. TECH-001: Breaking Change from Slug to Tag-based Filtering

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: High - Complete replacement of existing filtering logic
**Impact**: Medium - Could cause content display issues during transition
**Mitigation**:

- Implement graceful fallback mechanism
- Comprehensive testing of all tool index pages
- Feature flag for gradual rollout if needed

**Testing Focus**: Verify all existing content appears correctly, test edge cases with missing tags

### 3. DATA-001: Content Validation Gaps

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: Medium - Some articles may have malformed tag data
**Impact**: High - Could prevent content from appearing on tool pages
**Mitigation**:

- Implement robust error handling for missing/invalid tags
- Add content validation utility for bulk operations
- Graceful degradation for articles with tag issues

**Testing Focus**: Test with various tag data scenarios (missing, empty, malformed, invalid values)

## Detailed Risk Register

| Risk ID | Category | Description | Probability | Impact | Score | Priority | Mitigation Status |
|---------|----------|-------------|-------------|--------|-------|----------|-------------------|
| PERF-001 | Performance | Build time increase 10-15% | High (3) | Medium (2) | 6 | High | Mitigation planned |
| TECH-001 | Technical | Breaking change from slug to tag filtering | High (3) | Medium (2) | 6 | High | Fallback mechanism planned |
| DATA-001 | Data | Content with missing/invalid tags | Medium (2) | High (3) | 6 | High | Error handling implemented |
| TECH-002 | Technical | Architecture shift complexity | Medium (2) | Medium (2) | 4 | Medium | Story analysis complete |
| PERF-002 | Performance | Memory usage during build process | Medium (2) | Medium (2) | 4 | Medium | Monitoring implemented |
| DATA-002 | Data | Privacy/compliance with tag data | Low (1) | High (3) | 3 | Low | No sensitive data involved |
| BUS-001 | Business | User discovery feature effectiveness | Low (1) | High (3) | 3 | Low | AC validation required |
| TECH-003 | Technical | Integration with existing content structure | Medium (2) | Low (1) | 2 | Low | Content migration complete |

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests

- Performance regression testing for build time
- Content validation testing with various tag scenarios
- Breaking change validation across all tool pages

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests

- Integration testing between tag filtering and existing components
- Error handling testing for malformed content
- Memory usage monitoring during build process

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests

- Standard functional tests for tag filtering
- Regression test suite for existing functionality
- Edge case testing for unusual tag combinations

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

- All critical risks (score 9) - None identified
- High risks affecting core functionality (PERF-001, TECH-001, DATA-001)
- Performance monitoring implementation
- Error handling for missing/invalid tags

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- Medium risks with compensating controls (TECH-002, PERF-002)
- Low risks with monitoring in place (DATA-002, BUS-001, TECH-003)

### Accepted Risks

- Build time performance impact (accepted with monitoring)
- Minimal user impact during transition (accepted with fallback)

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- Build time metrics for PERF-001
- Content display error rates for DATA-001
- User journey completion rates for BUS-001
- Error logging for malformed tag data

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- Performance benchmarks exceed targets
- Content validation issues discovered
- User feedback indicates discovery problems
- New content types added to the system
