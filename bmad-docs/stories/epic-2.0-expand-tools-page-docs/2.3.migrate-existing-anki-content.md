# Story 2.3: Validate Existing Anki Content Schema Compliance

### Status
- **âœ… COMPLETED**

### Story
**As a** Content Manager,
**I want** to verify that the existing Anki article in the new content collection structure conforms to the established schema,
**so that** I can ensure it meets quality standards and is ready for the dynamic page rendering system.

### Acceptance Criteria
1.  [x] The existing file `apa-itu-anki.md` is confirmed to be located at `src/content/tool-articles/anki/apa-itu-anki.md`.
2.  [x] The frontmatter of the file is verified to match the `tool-articles` schema defined in Story 2.1.
3.  [x] All required schema fields are confirmed present: `title`, `description`, `publishedDate`, `toolName`, `toolCategory`, and `tags`.
4.  [x] Optional schema fields are verified for completeness and accuracy.
5.  [x] The content renders correctly without schema validation errors.
6.  [x] The build process completes successfully with the existing content.

### Tasks / Subtasks
-   [x] Task 1: Verify the `apa-itu-anki.md` file is correctly located at `src/content/tool-articles/anki/apa-itu-anki.md`.
-   [x] Task 2: Audit the existing frontmatter against the `tool-articles` schema requirements.
-   [x] Task 3: Validate that all required fields are present and correctly formatted.
-   [x] Task 4: Verify optional fields meet schema standards and enhance content discoverability.
-   [x] Task 5: Test the build process to ensure no schema validation errors occur.
-   [x] Task 6: Verify content renders correctly in the development environment.
-   [x] Task 7: Document any schema compliance issues or recommendations for improvement.

### Dev Notes
This story focuses on validation and verification rather than migration, as the content has already been moved to the correct location with comprehensive frontmatter. The following architectural and design standards **must** be adhered to in all related stories.

#### Current State Analysis
- **File Location**: âœ… Already correctly located at `src/content/tool-articles/anki/apa-itu-anki.md`
- **Frontmatter Status**: âœ… Appears to have comprehensive frontmatter matching schema requirements
- **Migration Status**: âœ… Content migration appears to have been completed previously
- **Focus**: Schema validation and build process verification

#### Responsive Design Strategy
-   **Mobile-First Approach:** All UI components and layouts must be developed mobile-first. Styles should be written for the smallest breakpoint (`320px`) first, and then use `min-width` media queries to add or adjust styles for larger screens.

#### Breakpoints
-   The following official project breakpoints must be used:
    -   `320px` (Smallest mobile devices)
    -   `640px` (sm, Large mobile / small tablets)
    -   `768px` (md, Tablets)
    -   `1024px` (lg, Laptops/Desktops)
    -   `1280px` (xl, Large desktops)

#### CSS Unit Usage Guide
-   **REM:** This is the **preferred and default unit** for most CSS properties, including `font-size`, `margin`, `padding`, and `width`/`height` on containers. It ensures a predictable and scalable design relative to the root font size.
-   **EM:** Use `em` units for properties that need to scale relative to the `font-size` of their direct parent. This is useful for things like the padding on a button or the size of an icon within a text element.
-   **PX:** Use `px` units sparingly and only for properties that require a fixed, non-scalable value. Good use cases include `border-width`, `box-shadow` offsets, or the dimensions of a raster image like a logo.

#### Protected Components - DO NOT MODIFY

**CRITICAL**: The following components and files must NOT be changed, modified, or touched during Story 2.3 implementation:

##### HTML/Astro Components (DO NOT TOUCH)
- `src/pages/tools.astro` - Main tools page layout and structure
- `src/layouts/BaseLayout.astro` - Base layout component
- `src/components/` - All existing UI components
- `src/pages/tools/[tool]/[...slug].astro` - Dynamic article page (if exists)
- `src/pages/tools/[tool]/index.astro` - Dynamic tool index page (if exists)

##### CSS/Styling (DO NOT TOUCH)
- `src/styles/global.css` - Global styles and design system
- `src/styles/` - All existing style files
- `tailwind.config.mjs` - Tailwind configuration
- `public/css/` - Public CSS assets
- Any existing responsive design breakpoints or CSS variables

##### JavaScript/TypeScript (DO NOT TOUCH)
- `src/utils/` - All utility functions and helpers
- `src/scripts/` - All existing client-side scripts
- `src/types/` - TypeScript type definitions
- `astro.config.mjs` - Astro configuration
- `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript configuration
- `package.json` - Dependencies and scripts

##### Content Files (DO NOT TOUCH)
- `src/content/docs/` - Documentation content collection
- `src/content/templates/` - Template collection
- Any existing content files outside of the target validation file

##### Build and Configuration (DO NOT TOUCH)
- Build scripts and processes
- Environment configurations
- Deployment configurations
- Any existing CI/CD pipelines

**Implementation Scope**: Story 2.3 is LIMITED to:
1. **Content validation only** - No file creation, modification, or deletion
2. **Schema compliance verification** - Frontmatter validation against existing schema
3. **Build process testing** - Verification that existing content works with current system
4. **Documentation updates** - Story document updates only

**Violation Consequences**: Modifying protected components will result in:
- Story rejection and rollback
- Potential system instability
- Violation of epic scope boundaries
- Required rework and validation

### Testing

#### Testing Standards
Based on architecture requirements, the following testing standards must be followed:

- **Test file location**: No specific test files required for content validation
- **Test standards**: Manual verification of Astro build process and content rendering
- **Testing frameworks**: Astro's built-in content validation and build system
- **Specific testing requirements**: 
  - Verify Astro build completes without schema validation errors
  - Confirm content renders correctly on development server
  - Validate frontmatter schema compliance
  - Test build process with existing content

#### Validation Steps
1. **Schema Validation**: Run `npm run build` to verify Astro content collection schema validation passes
2. **Content Rendering**: Start development server with `npm run dev` and navigate to the existing content
3. **Frontmatter Verification**: Confirm all required schema fields are present and correctly formatted
4. **Build Process**: Ensure static site generation completes successfully with existing content
5. **Schema Compliance Audit**: Verify all frontmatter fields match the defined schema exactly

#### Test Scenarios
- **Positive Test**: Existing content passes schema validation and builds successfully
- **Negative Test**: Verify build fails gracefully if any required fields are removed
- **Edge Case**: Verify special characters in content don't break rendering
- **Compliance Test**: Verify all frontmatter fields conform to schema requirements
