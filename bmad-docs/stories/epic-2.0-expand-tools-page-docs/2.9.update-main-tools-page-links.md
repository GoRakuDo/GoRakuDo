### Dev Notes
This story is the foundation for all subsequent work in this epic. The following architectural and design standards **must** be adhered to in all related stories.

#### Responsive Design Strategy
-   **Mobile-First Approach:** All UI components and layouts must be developed mobile-first. Styles should be written for the smallest breakpoint (`320px`) first, and then use `min-width` media queries to add or adjust styles for larger screens.

#### Breakpoints
-   The following official project breakpoints must be used:
    -   `320px` (Smallest mobile devices)
    -   `640px` (sm, Large mobile / small tablets)
    -   `768px` (md, Tablets)
    -   `1024px` (lg, Laptops/Desktops)
    -   `1280px` (xl, Large desktops)

#### CSS Unit Usage Guide
-   **REM:** This is the **preferred and default unit** for most CSS properties, including `font-size`, `margin`, `padding`, and `width`/`height` on containers. It ensures a predictable and scalable design relative to the root font size.
-   **EM:** Use `em` units for properties that need to scale relative to the `font-size` of their direct parent. This is useful for things like the padding on a button or the size of an icon within a text element.
-   **PX:** Use `px` units sparingly and only for properties that require a fixed, non-scalable value. Good use cases include `border-width`, `box-shadow` offsets, or the dimensions of a raster image like a logo.

#### File Structure and Integration Points
-   **Current Tools Data Location:** `src/pages/tools.astro` lines 18-65 (tools constant array)
-   **Target Dynamic Routes:** 
    -   `/tools/anki` → `src/pages/tools/[tool]/index.astro` (tool=anki)
    -   `/tools/yomitan` → `src/pages/tools/[tool]/index.astro` (tool=yomitan) - **CRITICAL: Tool ID mapping correction**
    -   `/tools/migaku` → `src/pages/tools/[tool]/index.astro` (tool=migaku)
-   **Content Source:** `src/content/tool-articles/{tool-name}/` directories
-   **Existing Implementation:** Dynamic routing system already implemented in Stories 2.4-2.8

#### Critical Tool ID Mapping Correction
**IMPORTANT:** There is a system inconsistency that must be resolved:
- **Source Code Reality:** `src/pages/tools.astro` shows `id: "yomichan"` (line 33)
- **Content Directory Reality:** `src/content/tool-articles/` contains `yomitan/` directory
- **Dynamic Routing Expectation:** `src/pages/tools/[tool]/index.astro` expects `yomitan` (line 33: `validTools = ["anki", "migaku", "yomitan"]`)
- **Solution:** Rename the tool ID from `"yomichan"` to `"yomitan"` in the main tools page to maintain system consistency across all components

#### ⚠️ CRITICAL: WHAT MUST NOT BE CHANGED OR TOUCHED ⚠️

**🚨 STERN WARNING: COMPLIANCE MANDATORY - SYSTEM INTEGRITY AT RISK**

**HTML Structure - ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN TO MODIFY:**
- **Navigation Components:** `<Navbar client:visible />` - Critical for site-wide navigation
- **Background Animation Elements:** 
  - `<canvas id="waveCanvas" class="wave-canvas" aria-hidden="true"></canvas>`
  - `<div class="stars" id="stars" aria-hidden="true"></div>`
- **Main Content Structure:** `<main class="main-content min-h-screen tools-layout-optimized">`
- **Section Structure:** All `<section>` elements with their classes and attributes
- **Tool Grid Container:** `<div class="tools-grid max-w-7xl mx-auto grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-6 sm:gap-8 lg:gap-10 tools-migration-enabled">`
- **Tool Card Structure:** All `<article>`, `<header>`, `<div>`, and `<footer>` elements within tool cards

**CSS Classes and Styling - COMPLETELY OFF-LIMITS:**
- **Design System Variables:** All CSS custom properties in `:root` (lines 1-50 in tools.css)
- **Responsive Breakpoints:** All `@media` queries and responsive design classes
- **Animation Classes:** All transition, animation, and interaction state classes

-   **Static Generation:** All pages remain statically generated with no runtime dependencies
-   **Animation Preservation:** Existing wave animations, star effects, and micro-interactions must remain functional
-   **Accessibility:** Maintain WCAG 2.1 AA compliance established in previous stories

#### Testing
**Test File Location Standards:**
-   **Unit Tests:** `src/__tests__/` directory (if exists) or create `tests/` directory
-   **Integration Tests:** Same location as unit tests
-   **E2E Tests:** `tests/e2e/` directory (if exists) or create

**Testing Frameworks and Patterns:**
-   **Primary Framework:** Astro's built-in testing capabilities
-   **Fallback:** Manual testing with browser dev tools and network inspection
-   **Test Pattern:** Component-level testing for link functionality

**Specific Testing Requirements for This Story:**
