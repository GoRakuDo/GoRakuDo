# Story 2.11: Enhance Tool Index Page Layout to Match Docs Page Structure

### Status
- **✅ COMPLETED** - Enhanced layout implemented with Docs Page structure consistency

### Story
**As a** User,
**I want** the tool index pages to have a consistent layout structure similar to the Docs page,
**so that** I have a familiar and cohesive browsing experience across the site.

### Enhancement Overview
This story enhances the existing tool index page (`src/pages/tools/[tool]/index.astro`) to match the Docs Page structure while preserving all existing functionality and performance optimizations.

### Changes Implemented

#### 1. Layout Structure Enhancement
- **Row 1**: Global Navbar (using existing `<Navbar client:visible />`)
- **Row 2**: Tool Header Section with two columns:
  - **Column 1**: Tool Image/Icon display (24x24 on mobile, 32x32 on desktop)
  - **Column 2**: Tool information with three rows:
    - **Row 1**: Tool Name (responsive typography)
    - **Row 2**: Tool Badges (Tool Guide badge + Article count)
    - **Row 3**: Tool Description
- **Row 3**: Articles list using `posts-grid` class (matching Docs Page structure)
- **Row 4**: Pagination component (identical to Docs Page implementation)

#### 2. Visual Enhancements
- Tool icon display in gradient background container
- Responsive badge system showing tool type and article count
- Consistent typography and spacing using existing design tokens
- Background elements (wave canvas and stars) for visual consistency

#### 3. Technical Implementation
- Reuses existing CSS from `docs.css` for consistency
- Maintains all existing performance monitoring and caching
- Preserves security validations and error handling
- Uses existing pagination logic from Docs Page
- Implements proper responsive breakpoints

### Files Modified
- `src/pages/tools/[tool]/index.astro` - Complete layout restructure

### Key Features Preserved

- ✅ Docs Page-consistent layout structure with proper sections
- ✅ Pagination component identical to Docs Page
- ✅ Enhanced visual hierarchy with proper spacing
- ✅ Background animations for visual consistency
- ✅ Call-to-action section for community engagement

### Design System Integration

- Consistent with site-wide navigation and layout patterns

### Performance Impact
- No impact on build performance (reuses existing components)
